OOPS - probably evolved just out of the need to write cleaner code

Inheritance: Move up a common object with common functions
Encapsulation: Make sure only the right things have the required access
Polymorphism: Ability to give specificity to behaviour of child classes
Abstraction: Ditch the stupid code in base class

Interfaces: Move up an abstract class with just the behaviours
